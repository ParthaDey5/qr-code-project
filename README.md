## **Future Improvements**
Here are some enhancements I’d like to explore:
- **Adding hover effects** to improve UI interactions.
- **CSS animations** to make the QR code fade in smoothly.
- **Exploring JavaScript** for dynamic behaviors (like copying the QR code link).
- Making the design **more accessible** by improving contrast and ARIA attributes.
